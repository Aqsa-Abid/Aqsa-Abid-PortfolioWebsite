<p>I've launched my YouTube channel half an year ago where I'm teaching students c++ language.I use my YouTube channel to share my work with a wider audience and to connect with other developers. I have found that it is a great way to get feedback on my work and to learn from other developers. you can find my youtube channel

<h2>Work:</h2>
  <h3>Project 1</h3>
  <img src="library.png" alt="This is an image" height="80"   />
  <h4>Discription</h4>
  <p>
    This project is a library management system that allows users to search for
    books, check out books, and return books. The system is implemented in C++
    and uses pointers. The project includes the following features:
    <ul>
      <li>A user
        interface that allows users to search for books by title or ID.</li>
      <li>A system for inserting Books</li>
      <li>A system for issuing books to students</li>
      <li>A system for returning books.</li>
      <li>A system for tracking the
        status of books (e.g., checked out, returned, overdue).</li>
    </ul>
      The project was
    developed using the following technologies:
    <ul>
      <li style="list-style-type: square">C++ </li>
      <li style="list-style-type: square">Pointers</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: square">Object-oriented
        programming </li>
    </ul>
The project was developed over a period of two months. I am
    proud of the work I did on this project. I learned a lot about C++,
    pointers, and object-oriented programming.
